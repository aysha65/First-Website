<h2>About me</h2>
After graduating college with a Psychology degree, I went to work for a major hospital system in Georgia. When the pandemic hit, the need for technology increased with the use of tele-health doctor visits. Then, an idea to link mental health and technology popped in my head. 
<br> Software engineering and web development has always held my interest. Being a student at Thinkful has not only motivated me to create and build my own website and apps, but has also provided the tools to collaborate and gain experience alongside others that are in the same position as I am.
  <br>Outside of software, I enjoy traveling and exploring what the state has to offer. From experiencing the culture, to connecting with nature in the mountains, to swimming in the Atlantic in Savannah.
